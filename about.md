I’m a final-year Geospatial Engineering student passionate about spatial data analysis and environmental sustainability. I’ve led projects on forest change detection, poverty analysis, and crop monitoring using Google Earth Engine and QGIS.

I have participated in OSM mapathons, worked with the Ministry of Lands, and contributed to climate-based yield prediction models. My goal is to become an adept industry professional contributing to real-world solutions with geospatial technology.
